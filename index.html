    <h4>Home Page : Introduction to Robotics and its Applications</h4>
    <p>Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition.</p>
    
    <p>The development of robotics has been driven by the need for automated systems that can perform tasks without human intervention, as well as by the desire to replicate the abilities and intelligence of the human mind. This has led to the creation of a wide variety of robots, from simple machines that can perform repetitive tasks to highly advanced robots that can think and learn.</p>

    <h4>Robots in Industry : Key Advancedments in Industrial Automation</h4>

    <p>Industrial mobile robots offer numerous advantages, including increased operational flexibility, reduced labour costs, improved production efficiency, and the ability to automate complex tasks without human intervention. Their mobility and adaptability make them perfect for dynamic factory environments.</p>

    <p>One of the most common uses of industrial mobile robots is the transportation of materials within factories. Autonomous mobile robots are used to move parts, components or finished products between different areas of the production plant without any human intervention. They can also assemble components while moving from one workstation to another, integrating the work of different areas of the factory into a single continuous process. This increases flexibility and reduces waiting times between different phases of the production process.Unlike traditional fixed transporters or automated guided vehicles (AGVs), AMRs can make real-time decisions on the best route to take, avoiding obstacles and adjusting to the conditions of the environment.</p>

    <h4>Humanoid Robots : OverView of Humanoid Robots and their Capabilities</h4>

    <P>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requires emergent intelligence, autonomous agency, functional visibility, and physical embodiment. While today's large language models excel at the first two, they lack the latter qualities of environmental perception and physical instantiation. Intelligent robots are viewed as the most promising path to achieving those missing pieces of the AGI puzzle.</P>

    <p>Intelligent humanoid robots are designed with human-like forms and functions â€“ anthropomorphic limbs, mobility skills, sensory perception, learning, and cognition. They represent the pinnacle of complexity and control challenges among all types of robots. Humanoid robots are often used to assist or substitute humans in various tasks. With bipedal locomotion mirroring humans, these robots can seamlessly collaborate alongside people in real-world settings.</p>
